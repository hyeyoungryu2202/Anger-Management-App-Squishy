# Anger-Management-App-Squishy

Squishy was intended to solve the anger management problem of Koreans in a short-term (physical and external) and a long-term (emotional and internal) manner.
Anger cannot be resolved without a proper care by the rage holders themselves.
With Squishy, the rage holders can look at their own anger in an objective way and realize their problem without making up excuses to protect themselves from facing the reality.
Furthermore, although Squishy tries to deal with instant anger releases with the Squishy doll and the pressure sensor, the act of recording the pressures as temperatures and comparing the records with others will help the users realize the problem on their own and be more willing to try the solutions that Squishy provides.
Since the solutions that Squishy provides is based on the personality type of the user, the user will be able to learn many long-term, effective solutions to deal with his anger and not express in an antisocial, violent, external way or an internal way such as Hwa-Byung.
By keeping the app functions to reach its maximum potential with minimum features, Squishy will be the optimal solution to resolve the anger management issues which has been improperly dealt with in Korea and the cure that was in need for establishing a healthier and less rage-filled society.
